  abstract = {Delineation of the cardiac structures from 2D echocardiographic images is a common clinical task to establish a diagnosis. Over the past decades, the automation of this task has been the subject of intense research. In this paper, we evaluate how far the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural network methods can go at assessing 2D echocardiographic images, i.e., segmenting cardiac structures and estimating clinical indices, on a dataset, especially, designed to answer this objective. We, therefore, introduce the cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation dataset, the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for the purpose of echocardiographic assessment. The dataset contains two and four-chamber acquisitions from 500 patients with reference measurements from one cardiologist on the full dataset and from three cardiologists on a fold of 50 patients. Results show that encoder-decoder-based architectures outperform state-of-the-art non-deep learning methods and faithfully reproduce the expert analysis for the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes, with a mean correlation of 0.95 and an absolute mean error of 9.5 ml. Concerning the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, results are more contrasted with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.80 and an absolute mean error of 5.6\%. Although these results are below the inter-observer scores, they remain slightly worse than the intra-observer's ones. Based on this observation, areas for improvement are defined, which open the door for accurate and fully-automatic analysis of 2D echocardiographic images.},

  abstract = {Machine learning analysis of biomedical images has seen significant recent advances. In contrast, there has been much less work on medical videos, despite the fact that videos are routinely used in many clinical settings. A major bottleneck for this is the the lack of openly available and well annotated medical video data. Computer vision has benefited greatly from many open databases which allow for collaboration, comparison, and creation of medical task specific architectures. We present the EchoNet-Dynamic Dataset of 10,036 echocardiography videos, spanning the range of typical echocardiography lab imaging conditions, with corresponding labeled measurements including ejection fraction, left ventricular volume at end-systole and end-diastole, and human expert tracings of the left ventricle as an aid in studying automated approaches to evaluate cardiac function. We additionally present the performance of three 3D convolutional architectures for video classification used to assess ejection fraction to near-expert human performance and as a benchmark for further collaboration, comparison, and creation of task-specific architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest labeled medical video dataset made available publicly to researchers and medical professionals and first public report of video-based 3D convolutional architectures to assess cardiac function.},
