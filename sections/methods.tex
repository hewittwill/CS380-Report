\subsection{Segmentation of Echocardiography Frames}

For the first part of this body of work, we develop a baseline segmentation
accuracy when segmenting echo frames using an encoder-decoder neural network.
For our work, we used the well-known U-Net architecture. \newline

For all the experiments in this work, we used the CAMUS datast
\cite{leclercDeepLearningSegmentation2019} which, in addition to providing
baseline segmentation scores using the UNet and UNet++ architecture was also the
dataset behind the C-GAN work of Abdi et al. All of the experiments were run
using Python 3 and TensorFlow 2.0.0.\newline

The CAMUS dataset was downloaded and converted from .MHD/.RAW format to a NumPy
array using the SimpleITK library for Python. Apical 2 Chamber (A2C) frames at
ES and ED (only the ground truth for ES and ED is provided) were extracted,
resampled to 256x256 and pixel values normalised to 0-1. All preprocessing steps
were carried out using NumPy and OpenCV, before being saved as a NumPy array to
avoid re-processing. Ground Truth (GT) segmentation maps were saved in one-hot
encoded style, also using NumPy arrays for consistency. \newline
